Are There Hidden Truths in Dreams?
Imagine waking up after dreaming about a horrible plane crash. The next day you plan to make a plane journey that you have planned long before. Will you get on the plane?
A survey shows that you may not cancel your trip but your dream will probably influence your thoughts just as if there had been a real plane accident.
The study says that dreams are a window to the mind and they may influence what we are really doing while we are awake.
Until Sigmund Freud published his famous book on "The Interpretation of Dreams" in 1899 we hadn't really thought very much about what dreams mean. Freud called dreams a "path to the unconscious" and for more than a century researchers and scientists have been trying to find out what dreams mean.
The interpretation of dreams is still an unclear area. A team of researchers at Harvard University are entering a new field of studies: Do dreams actually influence our behavior?
They have conducted studies in different cultures and found out that dreams contain hidden truths. Commuters in Boston, for example, said that dreams affected the way they live and work. 68% said that dreams foretell the future and 63% said that at least one of their dreams have come true.
Researchers, however, warn that dreams may also lead to trouble as well. If you dream that your husband or wife is cheating on you, you may be so influenced by this so much that it could cause problems in your relationship or even provoke an affair.
