The President of the United States is probably the most powerful leader of the world. He has many duties, like signing bills and commanding the armed forces. The president's advisors get together in the Cabinet.
Congress and the Supreme Court control the president and his decisions.
America has had great presidents: George Washington, the first president of the newly formed United States, Abraham Lincoln who abolished slavery, Franklin D. Roosevelt who led Amercia through World War II or John F. Kennedy , a popular president who was assassinated in Dallas.
A presidential election is held every four years. Americans do not choose their president directly . Instead they vote for electors who get together in the Electoral College.
