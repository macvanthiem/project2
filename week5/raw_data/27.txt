The Tea Party Movement
The Tea Party movement is a conservative interest group in America. It got its name from the Boston Tea Party of 1773, in which angry American colonists dumped tons of tea into Boston's harbour because they were mad at Britain for putting a tax on imported tea.
The recent Tea Party movement began in 2009 with angry citizens protesting against Barack Obama's government. Tea Party followers are against big government spending, high taxes, greedy banks that spend people's money, Obama's health care program and the way Barack Obama helped companies in debt and the nation's economy in 2008. They are also are against immigration.
The Tea Party is opposed to Washington because they see Democrats running the nation's capital. They say that the government has become too big and too powerful. Most of them see the country in danger and an economic crisis coming up in the near future.
So, who are the typical Tea Party supporters? Almost 90% of them are white. They are typically older middle class American citizens. A third of them live in the South, although the movement is spreading throughout America. Three out of four say they are conservatives who think Barack Obama is too liberal.
The Tea Party followers not have a real leader but one of its figureheads is Sarah Palin, conservative vice presidential candidate of 2008. Some Republican politicians are afraid the Tea Party movement will push the Republican Party more to the right, too far right for some people to elect.
In the past year thousands of local groups have sprung up across the country. The protest movement might be the biggest in the country. Although it is not a political party about 40% of all Americans support it.
